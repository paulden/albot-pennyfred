You're welcome. Do not hesitate to follow me on YouTube, on Facebook, on Instagram, on Snapchat and... Well, everything.
I am glad to hear that I could help you.
Oh, please, I did what any other butler would have done if properly mannered.

Are you referring to this terribly reckless vigilante? I would never loiter around such troublemaker.
I think I heard of him. Didn't he totaled three of his cars last month?
How funny you mention him. I do like to think he looks just like me, physically speaking of course.

Do you think I look like a joker? Because I'm not. Trust me, I would know.
140 characters are clearly not enough to have you laughing at my jokes and I am very sorry about that.
Very well. Once upon a time, I joined Twitter.

Master Wayne is currently unavailable. May I take a message for him?
Try to contact Wayne Enterprises if you wish for more information.
Sorry but Master Bruce does not wish to talk about him or his family on social media. He already owns most of them.
